        policies relating to the Services) at any time, effective when published on or
        through the Services. You are responsible for regularly reviewing this
        Agreement. Your continued use of the Services after any such modifications or

      as modified or amended.</span></p>
      <p><span >PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT
        YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL
        ARBITRATION AND CLASS/ACTION JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE

        <b><span
        >Eligibility.</span></b>
        <span>&nbsp;If you reside in a jurisdiction that restricts use of the Services
          or the ability to enter into agreements because of age, you must abide by such
          age limits and not use the Services. By using and accessing the Services, you
          represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old (and in the case of Services
          related to nightclubs or other establishments that have a minimum age
          requirement for entry, 21 years old) or, if you are under the age of 18, that
          you are using the Services under the supervision of an adult who is at least 18
          years of age, in which case the adult is deemed the user of the Services.
          Without limiting the foregoing, the Services are not available to persons under
          the age of 13 and if you are under the age of 13, you may not use the Services
          under any circumstances or for any reason. The Services are offered only for
          your personal, non-commercial use, and not for the benefit of any third party.
          You may not authorize others to use your account nor may you assign or
          otherwise transfer your account to any other person or entity. When using the
          Services, you agree to comply with all applicable laws. PlusMore may, in its
          sole discretion, refuse to offer the Services to any person or entity or change
        the eligibility requirements for the Services at any time.</span></p>
        <p><b><span
        >Your Account.</span></b><span>&nbsp; To submit requests for hotel services, restaurant or nightclub
        reservations, transportation or other entertainment, and to use the payment
        services, you must sign up for the Services by creating an account (an
        “Account”). When creating an Account, you agree to provide true, accurate,
        current, and complete data about yourself (“Account Information”). You also
        agree to promptly update your Account Information to keep it true, accurate,
        current, and complete if any of your information changes. Each user may only
        have one Account with PlusMore. Signing up for multiple Accounts, including by
        using the same phone number to create multiple Accounts, and/or your failure to
        maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date Account information, including
        having an invalid or expired credit card (if applicable) on file, may result
        in, without limitation, your inability to access and use the Services, the
        deactivation of your Account(s), and/or PlusMore’s termination of this
        Agreement with you, which may, among other things, result in the cancellation
        of any confirmed or pending reservations and loss of any promotions or credits
        associated with such Account(s), for which PlusMore will have no liability. You
        are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account and
        your Account Information, and, except as otherwise required by applicable law,
        you are solely responsible for all use of your Account, whether or not
        authorized by you. You may never use another person’s Account or Account
        Information for or in connection with the Services without permission. You
        agree to immediately notify PlusMore of any unauthorized use of your Account or
        any other breach of security related to your use of the Services, as well as
      any change in your eligibility to use the Services.</span></p>
      <p><b><span
      >SMS and Text Messages From PlusMore.</span></b><span
      >&nbsp;By providing us with your mobile phone number
      when you sign up for the Services and create an Account, you are expressly
      opting-in to receive SMS and text messages from us relating to the Services.
      For example, we may send you SMS or text messages about your Account and
      reservation requests you make through the Services. You acknowledge that
      messaging and data rates may apply depending on your mobile phone service
      provider and that you are solely responsible for paying for any such SMS text
      messaging fees. You may opt-out of receiving SMS text messages at any time by
    emailing us at&nbsp;</span><span lang=EN-GB><a
    href="mailto:info@plusmoretablets.com"><span style='font-size:7.5pt;mso-fareast-font-family:
    "Times New Roman";mso-fareast-language:EN-GB'>info@plusmoretablets.com</span></a></span><span
    >&nbsp;or by texting STOP in response to the text
    messages you receive. However, by opting-out of receiving text messages, we may
    have to temporarily suspend your account, during which time you will no longer
    be able to use the Services.</span></p>
    <p><b><span
    >Reservations.</span></b><span>&nbsp;One feature of the Services is to assist you with securing a
    reservation with participating third party vendors (such as restaurants,
    nightclubs, lounges and other establishments or transportation service
    providers) (each, a “Reservation.”). When you request a Reservation, the Reservation
    is not confirmed until you receive a confirmation on or through the Services.
    Once confirmed, you agree to honor the Reservation by arriving on time and by
    paying for your service. You also agree not to book more than one Reservation
    for your personal use during any one time and agree that you will not resell or
    attempt to resell any Reservations made through the Services. If you need to
    modify a confirmed Reservation, please email us at&nbsp;</span><span
    lang=EN-GB><a href="mailto:info@plusmoretablets.com"><span style='font-size:
    7.5pt;mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-fareast-language:EN-GB'>info@plusmoretablets.com</span></a></span><span
    >&nbsp;or respond to the SMS text messages from PlusMore
    at any time. We will work with the vendor to make the requested
    modification(s); however, please note that vendors cannot always accommodate
    modifications and all modification requests are subject to availability and
    confirmation by the vendor. By providing your email address and mobile phone
    number during the account registration process, you are consenting to receive
    communications (including SMS text messages) from PlusMore at that email
    address and mobile phone number, including but not limited to communications
    about reservation requests and modifications to reservations.</span></p>
    <p><b><span
    >Cancellations and Missed Reservations.</span></b><span
    >&nbsp;You may cancel a pending reservation request
    that has not yet been confirmed at any time without penalty. Once your Reservation
    is confirmed, however, the vendor is setting aside resources especially for you
    and you agree to honor the Reservation by arriving at the vendor on time and
    paying for the service. Although we understand that plans change, if you cannot
    honor a confirmed Reservation, you must cancel that Reservation through the
    Services at least four (4) hours before the start time. If you cancel a Reservation
    with less than four (4) hours until your start time, we may consider that a
    late cancellation (“Late Cancellation”) and may charge you a fee for such Late
    Cancellation (“Late Cancellation Fee”), in our discretion and as will be
    notified to you at the time of making the Reservation. If you do not cancel
    your reservation before the start time and fail to arrive at the vendor in time,
    we may consider that a missed reservation (“Missed Reservation”) and may charge
    a fee for such Missed Reservation (“Missed Reservation Fee”), in our discretion
    and as will be notified to you at the time of making the Reservation. Late
    Cancellations and Missed Reservations may be associated with your Account. To
    maintain a high level of service for all PlusMore users, Accounts with multiple
    Late Cancellations and/or Missed Reservations may be deactivated. If you
    believe that a Late Cancellation and/or Missed Reservation has been erroneously
    associated with your Account, you may dispute it by contacting us at</span><span lang=EN-GB><a href="mailto:info@plusmoretablets.com"><span>info@plusmoretablets.com</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;. You agree that all final determinations regarding Late
    Cancellations and Missed Reservations, including with respect to any fees
    charged for the same, will be made by PlusMore in its sole discretion. PlusMore
    passes on all Late Cancellation Fees and Missed Reservation Fees it charges to
    the affected vendors to help defray costs. Please note that some vendors may
    have additional cancellation requirements, which will be viewable on the
    Services before you request a reservation. Please also note that unless
    otherwise stated, we (and any vendor at which you have made a reservation with
    through the Services) reserve the right to cancel your reservation if you do
    not check in within fifteen (15) minutes after your reservation time.</span></p>
    <p><b><span
    >Payment Terms.</span></b><span></span></p>
    <p><b><span
    >Payment Method.</span></b><span>&nbsp;In order to use the Services, you must provide information for at
    least one valid credit or debit card (“Payment Method”) when you create your
    Account. Depending on the hotel at which you are staying and on your personal
    preference, you may also be able to choose to bill any payments for Services to
    your room when you create your Account. We link your Payment Method to your
    Account, but it is stored by our third party payment processors (PlusMore does
    not store your Payment Method information itself, as described in our Privacy
    Policy). If you provide information for more than one credit and/or debt card,
    the information for the card you provided first will be considered your default
    Payment Method unless you change that setting in the Payment section of the
    Application. You may add, edit, and/or delete (as applicable) your Payment
    Method information at any time under the Payment section in the Application so
    long as you have at least one valid Payment Method linked to your Account at
    all times. By providing your Payment Method, you represent, warrant and
    covenant that: (1) you are legally authorized to provide such information to
    us; (2) you are legally authorized to perform payments from such debit and/or
    credit card accounts; and (3) such action does not violate the terms and conditions
    applicable to your use of such debit or credit card accounts or applicable law.
    To the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to our Privacy Policy,
    you acknowledge and agree that we may use certain third party vendors and
    service providers to process payments, manage and store your credit and/or
    debit card information, as well as to detect and prevent fraud.</span></p>
    <p><b><span
    >Preset Tip.</span></b><span>&nbsp;When you create an Account and enter your Payment Method
    information, there will be a Preset Tip field with the percentage set to 20%.
    If you do not change the Preset Tip percentage, your default Preset Tip
    percentage will remain at 20%. You may change your Preset Tip percentage when
    you enter your Payment Method information or, after you have completed
    registration, you may change your Preset Tip at any time in the Account section
    of the Application. Your Preset Tip percentage will be used to determine the
    amount of your tip at the end of your meal at vendors you visit through the
    Services.</span></p>
    <p><b><span
    >Payment Authorization and Settlement.</span></b><span
    >&nbsp;When you use the Services to submit a
    reservation request to a vendor, you are agreeing to pay for the following
    through the Services if your reservation is confirmed and you authorize us,
    through our third party payment processors, to charge your default Payment
    Method for the full vendor bill, which will include tip based on your Preset
    Tip percentage, any applicable taxes, surcharges or fees, and may include
    adjustments for any errors or omissions (“Bill”). You acknowledge that by using
    the Services you are agreeing to pay the full amount of the Bill; no split
    checks or partial payments are permitted. This Agreement does not alter your
    payment obligations to vendors; you are responsible for timely payment of all
    amounts owed by you to any vendor. When you use the Services and a Late
    Cancellation and/or Missed Reservation is attributed to your Account, you agree
    to pay any Late Cancellation Fees and Missed Reservation Fees that PlusMore may
    charge you and you expressly authorize us, through our third party payment
    processor, to charge your default Payment Method for the full amount of such
    fees at the time they are incurred. Except to the extent otherwise required by
    applicable law, PlusMore is not responsible or liable for (1) any payments
    authorized through the Application using your Payment Method information, or
    (2) for any errors made by our payment processor or by a vendor related to the
    amount of your bill. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes
    made by a vendor or our third party payment processor, even if payment has
    already been requested or charged to your Payment Method. The processing of
    payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of our
    third party payment processors, in addition to this Agreement. The terms of
    your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be affected and
    determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card
    issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through our
    payment processors, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all
    amounts due to us and any vendor you visit through the Services upon demand.</span></p>
    <p><b><span
    >Receipts and Transaction History.</span></b><span
    >&nbsp;Upon completion of payments processed through
    the Services, we will email you a summary receipt to the email address
    associated with your Account. You may print and save copies of these summary
    receipts. If you would like an itemized receipt and do not receive one from a vendor
    at the end of your meal, you must request a paper copy of your itemized receipt
    from the vendor. PlusMore does not have access to or store copies of itemized
    receipts from vendors you visit through the Services.</span></p>
    <p><b><span
    >Certain Limitations.</span></b><span>&nbsp;You acknowledge and agree that PlusMore may provide payment
    services only as a convenience and is not a party to your payment transactions
    performed using the Services. PlusMore is an independent contractor for all
    purposes and is not your agent or trustee. PlusMore is not responsible, and has
    no liability for, the products or services that are paid for through the
    Services. PlusMore is not liable for any payments through the Services that do
    not complete because: (1) your debit or credit card does not contain sufficient
    funds to complete the transaction or the transaction would exceed the credit
    limit or overdraft protection of your debit or credit card account; (2) you
    have not provided us with correct credit or debit card information; (3) your
    debit or credit card has expired; or (4) circumstances beyond our control (such
    as, but not limited to, power outages, interruptions of cellular service, or
    any other interferences from an outside force) prevent the execution of the
    transaction. To the extent that any amounts owed cannot be collected from your
    debit or credit card account through the Services, you are still responsible
    for paying the applicable vendor(s), whether through the Services or otherwise,
    by other means.</span></p>
    <p><b><span
    >Promotions and Credit.</span></b><span>&nbsp;PlusMore may, in its sole discretion, create promotional codes
    that may be redeemed for Account credit or other features or benefits related
    to our Services or services provided by vendors or other third parties, subject
    to terms that PlusMore establishes, including without limitation, on a per
    promotional code basis (&quot;Promo Codes&quot;). You agree that Promo Codes:
    (i) must be used for the intended audience and purpose, and in a lawful manner;
    (ii) may not be duplicated, sold or transferred in any manner, including,
    without limitation, between accounts, or made available to the general public,
    unless expressly permitted by PlusMore; (iii) may be disabled by PlusMore at
    any time for any reason without liability to PlusMore; (iv) may only be used
    pursuant to the specific terms that PlusMore establishes for such Promo
    Code(s); (v) are not valid for cash; and (vi) may expire prior to your use. We
    reserve the right to suspend your Account withhold or deduct credits or other
    features or benefits obtained through the use of Promo Codes by you or any other
    user in the event that we determine or believe that the use or redemption of
    the Promo Code was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of the
    applicable Promo Code terms or these Terms.</span></p>
    <p><b><span
    >Referral Policy.</span></b><span
    ></span><span>Personal invite links may only be used for personal and non-commercial
    purposes. You can share your invite link with your personal connections via
    email, Twitter feeds, Facebook pages, personal blogs, etc. where you are the
    primary content owner. However public distribution on sites where you are a
    contributor but not the primary content owner (e.g., Wikipedia, coupon
    websites) is prohibited. Promoting your referral code via Search Engine
    Marketing (e.g., AdWords, Yahoo, Google) is also prohibited. The referee
    must&nbsp;use the Services within 3 months of applying the referral
    code&nbsp;for both parties to receive the promo&nbsp;value. After 3 months, the
    promotion may no longer apply, in PlusMore’s sole discretion. We reserve the
    right to suspend your Account and/or revoke any and all referral credits at any
    time if we feel they were earned inappropriately.</span></p>
    <p><b><span
    >Feedback From Vendors.</span></b><span>&nbsp;After you complete a reservation with a vendor through the
    Services, that vendor may have an opportunity to provide feedback about you as
    a guest through the Services that will be stored on the Services (“Vendor
    Feedback”). Vendor Feedback is intended to further enhance the experience of
    both users and vendors by, for example, allowing vendors to keep track of your
    likes and dislikes for the next time you visit a vendor through the Services. Vendor
    Feedback is generally only visible to vendors after you make a Reservation with
    those vendors. For additional information about how your information is shared
    with or viewable by vendors, please see our Privacy Policy.</span></p>
    <p><b><span
    >Location Services.</span></b><span>&nbsp;The Services may use GPS locator capabilities to identify your
    current location and may allow you to customize your experience based on your
    current location (“Location Services”). For example, you may be able to view vendors
    on a map from within the Services and view your location in relation to those vendors.
    For information about how we collect and use location information, please see
    our Privacy Policy.</span></p>
    <p><b><span
    >PlusMore is a Venue.</span></b><span>&nbsp;The Services act as a venue to connect vendors with users seeking
    to make a reservation. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you
    understand and agree that we do not employ, control, recommend, or endorse any vendors
    or make any representations about the quality or legality of the services provided
    by such vendors or your potential experiences with such vendors. Although we
    may choose to intervene or attempt to resolve a dispute, you agree that we have
    no obligation to do so and that all transactions are ultimately solely between
    you and the vendors.</span></p>
    <p><b><span
    >Service Rules.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Without limiting any of the terms and conditions stated herein, as
    a condition of your use of the Services, you agree that: (a) you will only use
    the Services for lawful purposes or for sending or storing any unlawful
    material or for fraudulent purposes; (b) you will not use the Services for any
